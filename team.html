        <h2><em><strong>The Team Behind This Project</strong></em></h2>
        <h3><em>Principle Investigator</em></h3>
        <p>Léa Denieul-Pinsky is a Ph.D candidate at Concordia University’s Geography, Planning, and Environment Department. She is dedicating her research to advance data driven visualizations  to end the dispossession of Indigenous lands in Canada. As a cartographer, she experiments with design to find different ways to engage both settler and Indigenous communities around the land-based issues that both unite and divide them. She is particularly interested in tracking where maps go after they are made, who mobilizes them and for what purposes. With this information in hand, she aims to identify better communication strategies to augment the ways Indigenous Land Back campaigns reach out to their target audiences.</p>
        <h3><em>Research Assistant</em></h3>
        <p>Noah Canon graduated from Concordia University in 2019 where he holds a B.A. (Honours)  and an M.A in Human Geography. His main scholarly interests relate to the relationship between settler colonial governance and knowledge production. His thesis Performing Indigenous well-being: Historical and political geographies of Canada's community well-being index explored the politics of state knowledge production about Indigenous peoples’ well-being. He is also interested in Indigenous-settler relations in socio-environmental struggles.</p>
        <h3><em>Website Developer</em></h3>
        <p>Gab Castelo graduated from Concordia University in 2022 with a BCompSc in Computer Applications with a Minor in Electroacoustic Studies.</p>
